ZTF Query LC
=======

A simple way to obtain a light curve (g, r and i band when available) from Zwicky Transient Facility's data given just a coordinate (ra, dec). I recommend you to also search for the object on IRSA Gator (https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/Gator/nph-dd) and certify that the coordinate is right, there could be close by objects.
